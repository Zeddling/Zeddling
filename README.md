<p align="center"><a href="https://github.com/Zeddling"><img width="100%" alt="Hello, I'm Victor. I do open source!" src="./README.png" /></a></p>

I'm a Kenyan backend engineer and tech consultant focusing more on building distributed systems. I also double as a Web3 engineer.

__About Me__
1. Java and Go are my daily bread
2. When the code doesn't work, I bang a chord on the piano

Got a project/hackathon you want to try out?
